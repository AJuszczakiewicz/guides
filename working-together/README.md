Working Together
==============

A guide for working well together.


Pair Programming
-------

**Before:**
* Agree Scope (Pairing for two hours? Until the ticket is complete? Just get pass the bug?)
* Agree Working Environment (Two keyboards? VIM/what other tools?)
* Agree Pairing Style (Time-based? Ping pong? To the next traffic light?)

**During:**
* Keep the chat going (Think aloud. Encourage/support)
* Keep switching (Follow the pairing style)
* Keep both involved ("Could we do this another way?")
* Keep breaking (Have a break, have a…)
* Keep checking in ("Could we google this separately?")

**After:**
* Ask for Feedback (What did we do well? What could we have done better? It’ll feel weird, do it anyway)
